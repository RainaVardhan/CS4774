        "This plot shows how Model 2's loan recommendation rate changes across age ranges, separated by whether loans were historically granted or denied. The orange line remains consistently high (around 0.8-0.9), indicating that applicants who were previously approved are also recommended by the model across most ages. The blue line stays much lower (around 0.1-0.3), showing that applicants who were historically denied continue to receive low recommendation rates. The green line reflects the overall trend, falling between the other two lines. A clear trend is that the overall recommendation rate increases gradually with age, suggesting that younger applicants are less likely to be recommended compared to older applicants. This age-dependent slope raises fairness concerns as age is a legally protected characteristic in lending. At the far right of the graph, the sharp spike upward followed by a sudden drop likely reflects sparse data in the oldest age bins. Overall, the plot indicates that Model 2 largely mirrors historical loan decisions, granting more approvals to those already approved in the past, but also reinforcing an age-related disparity. Younger applicants are systematically disadvantaged, which may pose risks of disparate impact and potential violations of fair lending laws."

        "Our results reveal that historical lending decisions reflect a fairness issue, with an explicit disparate impact between Black and White applicants (0.586 << 0.8). This means that Black applicants were approved at only 58.6% of the rate of White applicants. Model 1 (0.755) comes closer to reproducing this historical disparity than Model 2 (0.818), but both still overestimate approval rates for Black applicants, making them appear overly optimistic compared to reality. In contrast, both models perform well with respect to Asian and White applicants. The historical disparate impact ratio for Asians was 1.075, showing that Asian applicants were slightly more favored than White applicants, and both models reproduced this outcome. Thus, Asian applicants were not disadvantaged as a minority group, whereas Black applicants clearly were, and the models did not adequately capture that disadvantage.\n",

        "Both models and the actual historical approvals of loans granted are significantly lower than the proportion of White applicants' predicted and actual approval rate. Without a reasonable explanation of the disparity, this indicates evidence of discrimination against Black applicants. While the difference between actual granted loans and the models' predictions appears substantial, closer inspection shows the gap is less pronounced, especially for Black applicants. Based on Model 1's ratio (0.755), about 4094 Black applicants should have been approved, compared to the actual 3972—a difference of only about 3%. This suggests that Model 1's predictions are roughly consistent with historical outcomes, yet both history and the models still reflect the broader pattern of disadvantage against Black applicants."

In Model 1, the True Positive Rate (TPR) is higher for Asian applicants (0.889) than for Black applicants (0.794), while the False Positive Rate (FPR) varies widely (0.194 for White vs. 0.319 for Black). This indicates inconsistent error behavior across racial groups. Model 2 reduces these disparities, with both TPR and FPR more consistent across races, although Asian applicants have a slightly lower TPR (0.840) compared to Model 1. For age groups, Model 1 again shows imbalance. Applicants under 35 have a TPR of 0.826 and an FPR of 0.207, compared with 0.872 and 0.212 for applicants 35 and older. This means younger applicants face more false rejections of good loans and a higher rate of false approvals. Model 2 largely eliminates these disparities, producing very similar error rates across age categories. From the perspective of error rate parity, Model 1 fails to meet fairness standards across both race and age, while Model 2 achieves stronger parity and thus produces fairer outcomes."

        "In developing our final model, our main goal was to balance accuracy with fairness. The earlier models (Model 1 and Model 2) were reasonably accurate but replicated biased historical patterns, particularly disadvantaging younger and Black applicants. To address this, we trained a new model to predict annual repayment outcomes (“good_loan”) instead of reproducing past approvals, and we limited the features to financial indicators such as income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and loan amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also tested two different feature sets. The first excluded age and relied only on financial indicators, producing strong results compared with earlier models. The second included age, but the overall performance did not change significantly. The only differences were a slight increase in the True Positive Rate (TPR) for Asian applicants (+0.002) and a minor decrease for Black applicants (-0.001), suggesting that age added little predictive value while raising fairness concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new model performed strongly, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores than Model 1 and Model 2 while producing more balanced outcomes across groups. Disparate impact ratios moved closer to 1, and error rates across racial groups became more consistent. These results indicate that the model not only improves predictive performance but also better aligns with fairness principles and anti-discrimination standards in lending.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, the model is not perfect. Some disparities remain, particularly in False Positive Rates (FPR), which remain relatively high. Whether the model is considered fair ultimately depends on the fairness standard applied: those emphasizing high TPR and balanced disparate impact may judge it acceptable, whereas those emphasizing low FPR may still view it as problematic. Overall, however, the model represents a significant step toward reducing unfairness compared with earlier models."
